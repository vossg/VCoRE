After building / installing OpenSG

VCoRE:

1) Copy CMakeCacheInitial.platform.txt to CMakeCacheIntial.txt within the
   source directory.

2) Adjust CMake parameters in CMakeCacheInitial.txt

3) create build dir

4) in build dir run 'cmake <VCoRE Source>'

5) build

6) install (if required)


Note the initial cache adjusted in step 2 will only be read once 
during the very first cmake run. Changing it and rerunning cmake will
not include the latest changes. For this you must start over, e.g.
clear/recreate the build directory or delete the cmake cache inside
the build directory.
